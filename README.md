# Cells_Barcoding

/*Goal*/: Generate synthetic data of barcoded cells. 

/*Including: */
Seeding - a given number of cells with random barcodes set (Binomial/Poisson and others)

Propgating - grow cells with time

Sampling - sample a given fraction of cells from the underlie cells population. 

Dropouts - taking into account the probability that a barcode is not detected. 

Clones clustering - find the clones, and evaluate the linegaes construction errors.
